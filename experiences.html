            I have been taking care of 6 yo twins, Ivy and Rose. In the mornings, I had to prepare them to go to school, made breakfast and bring them to school.
            Most of the time, I was picking them up. Once at home we had a play time (drawing, coloring, playing games, jigsaw...) and I had to prepare healthy (and yummy) dinner.
            I was free during the school time. At first, I used this time to discover Manchester, visiting museums and walking throught unknown quarters of the city.
            After a few weeks, I started volunteering at the Whalley Range gardening club (every tuesdays) and at Open Kitchen (once a week), a zero waste kitchen for workers. 
            The last 4 months, I've been volunteering at the Oxfam Bookshop in Chorlton-Cum-Hardy (Monday to Friday). Those experiences have been great opportunities to improve my English
            (even if my best teachers were Ivy and Rose), to meet extraordinary people and to give me a reason to stay in England.

                    I was in charge of the raw materials database. My role was to reference all the new raw material and supplier, updating their informations and all the documents link to them.

                    <li>
                    I was also responsible for multiple competing projetcs e.g. harmonization of the supply chain or decreasing overall financial outputs. To achieve those goals,
                    I had to set up small to medium scale lab tests, sensory analysis and building reports. The major project was about the harmonization of all our vanilla aroma used in 4 
                    different factories around France. At the beginning, more than 80 aroma has been found. I had to go throught their caracteristics and try to regroup them into categories.
                    Then, compare them into same category and eliminate the ones with the same or very close flavor, or the ones we simplely didn't use anymore. We end up with around 40 aroma,
                    so half of what we had when started. The result was a huge gain of money (thousands of euro).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Another of my responsibilities was to deal with sudden emergencies within the factory which required swift resolution. The most common issue was a missing or 
                    nonconforming raw material. The best example I can give you is when I received a nonconform blackberry puree. The supplier told us it was due to the bad weather
                    all along this year, and the future deliveries will be the same quality. The issue is that the difference of taste and colour found in the puree would have consequences
                    on the final product so would result as a nonconform production of ice cream for us. We had to find a way throught without modifying the ingredients list as the packaging 
                    were already produced. Unfortunatly, I can't give you the secret recipe! The operation was a success.

            I've worked with the shop team during 3 summers and as a student job during 2 years. I was working on the shop floor, advising customers, sorting out stocks, creating new layout or simply tidying
            the shop. But also working at the checkout. It has been my first real professional experience and I'd loved it! The team was great and I had the opportunity to speak a bit of several languages 
            English, Spanish and Italian). This job gave me confidence to speak in front of strangers and larger groups.
