        First thing's first, I’m French and proud of my roots.<br> 
        I was an engineer in an ice cream factory. Yes, even if it was THE dream to eat ice cream everyday, I realised it wasn’t for me. 
        I had the feeling that I was supposed to do more, that I wasn’t in the right place. 
        So I decided to come to England as an au pair to take time to think, to open my mind and of course, learn English. 
        It was obviously the right choice! 
        I fell in love with Manchester, its vibes and its people. 
        The friends I met introduced me to the world of web development. 
        It was completely new to me, I used to be so scared of those words. 
        Very quickly I realised it was just like a construction game, where creativity can lose itself. Creation without borders! I just had to learn another language...
        It’s not that easy and I’m still learning but I'm enjoying every step. This website is one of my first projects, created from scratch with HTML5 and CSS (I am currently learning JavaScript). <br>
        Have a look around, I hope you’ll enjoy your journey!
